### Machine learning allows the program/algo to find the rules rather than letting human to hard code the rules

### Dense Vector Vs Sparse Vector:
Dense vector means that most of its values are non-zero. As a counter-example, a one-hot encoded vector is not "dense."

### One hot vector:
One-hot encoding is used in machine learning as a method to quantify categorical data. In short, this method produces a vector with length equal to the number of categories in the data set.

### Batch Vs Epoch
